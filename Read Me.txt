Changes made:
A added semaphore  added in fork.c.
The kernel has to be recompiled with this updated fork.c


How to make and run module:
1- Replace fork.c with new fork.c in linux-*/kernel
2- Build kernel using make and make install.
3- Reboot the system to reflect the changes.
4- Make and install the kernel module 'P2_try_4'

How to set threshold:
By default the threshold to detect a fork bomb is 10 tasks.
But it is configurable. The threshold value can be passed as a paremeter to the module when doing insmod. (No need to make module again)
e.g. to set threshold to 50 do this
insmod P2_try_4.ko 50
